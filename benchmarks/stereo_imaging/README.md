# Stereo Imaging Benchmark

## Problem

Plan optical satellite observations to acquire same-pass or bounded cross-satellite stereo and tri-stereo imagery over a set of ground targets.

The benchmark focuses on physically meaningful observation geometry and retargeting cost. It does not model photogrammetry internals, cloud cover, downlink, storage, or onboard power.

Given a set of real Earth-observation satellites with frozen TLEs and compact sensor and agility parameters, and a set of geo-referenced ground targets, the agent must produce a schedule of timed observation actions that maximizes stereo coverage and quality over a fixed planning horizon.

## Unit contract

All public quantities use SI units or degrees:

| Quantity | Unit | Suffix |
|---|---|---|
| distance, radius, altitude | meters | `_m` |
| area | square meters | `_m2` |
| time, duration | seconds | `_s` |
| speed | m/s | `_mps` |
| acceleration | m/s² | `_mps2` |
| angle | degrees | `_deg` |
| angular rate | deg/s | `_deg_per_s` |
| angular acceleration | deg/s² | `_deg_per_s2` |
| timestamps | ISO 8601 with `Z` or explicit offset (naive timestamps are rejected) | — |

## Dataset structure

```text

            └── mission.yaml
```

Each case is self-contained. The verifier reads one case directory and one solution file.

## Case file formats

### `satellites.yaml`

A YAML sequence. Each entry defines one satellite:

```yaml
- id: str
  norad_catalog_id: int
  tle_line1: str
  tle_line2: str

  pixel_ifov_deg: float          # angular IFOV of one pixel, cross-track direction
  cross_track_pixels: int        # number of cross-track detector pixels
  max_off_nadir_deg: float       # max tilt from nadir; see combined-angle formula in Hard action constraints

  max_slew_velocity_deg_per_s: float
  max_slew_acceleration_deg_per_s2: float
  settling_time_s: float

  min_obs_duration_s: float
  max_obs_duration_s: float
```

The verifier derives swath geometry from the angular sensor model:

```text
cross_track_fov_deg    = cross_track_pixels * pixel_ifov_deg
half_cross_track_fov_deg = 0.5 * cross_track_fov_deg
strip_half_width_m     ≈ slant_range_m * tan(half_cross_track_fov_deg)
```

### `targets.yaml`

A YAML sequence. Each entry defines one ground target:

```yaml
- id: str
  latitude_deg: float
  longitude_deg: float
  aoi_radius_m: float       # radius of the area of interest around the target center
  elevation_ref_m: float    # reference terrain elevation

  scene_type: urban_structured | vegetated | rugged | open
```

`scene_type` captures stereo matching difficulty and occlusion behavior as a planning abstraction. Hard validity does not depend on `scene_type`; stereo quality scores do.

### `mission.yaml`

```yaml
mission:
  horizon_start: ISO8601
  horizon_end: ISO8601

  allow_cross_satellite_stereo: true
  max_stereo_pair_separation_s: 7200

  validity_thresholds:
    min_overlap_fraction: 0.80
    min_convergence_deg: 5.0
    max_convergence_deg: 45.0
    max_pixel_scale_ratio: 1.5
    min_solar_elevation_deg: 10.0
    near_nadir_anchor_max_off_nadir_deg: 10.0

  quality_model:
    pair_weights:
      geometry: 0.50
      overlap: 0.35
      resolution: 0.15
    tri_stereo_bonus_by_scene:
      urban_structured: 0.12
      rugged: 0.10
      vegetated: 0.08
      open: 0.05
```

## Solution format

The agent submits a JSON file containing a single-case object:

**Single-case:**
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "observation",
      "satellite_id": "sat_pleiades_1a",
      "target_id": "urban_paris_01",
      "start_time": "2026-06-18T10:00:00Z",
      "end_time": "2026-06-18T10:00:08Z",
      "off_nadir_along_deg": 5.0,
      "off_nadir_across_deg": -2.0
    }
  ]
}
```

Each action specifies the satellite, target, time window, and boresight steering angles in the satellite local frame. The verifier ignores actions with `type` values other than `"observation"`.

## Hard action constraints

The verifier rejects a solution as invalid if any of the following hold:

- `end_time` is not strictly after `start_time`
- the observation window falls outside the mission horizon
- observation duration is outside `[min_obs_duration_s, max_obs_duration_s]`
- combined boresight off-nadir angle exceeds `max_off_nadir_deg`, where the angle (in degrees) is $\arctan\sqrt{\tan^2\alpha + \tan^2\beta}$ with $\alpha$ = `off_nadir_along_deg` and $\beta$ = `off_nadir_across_deg` (tangents use radians). This is the same geometric tilt from nadir the verifier uses when forming the boresight ray from those steering angles.
- the boresight ray does not intersect the Earth surface
- two observations on the same satellite overlap in time
- the slew-plus-settle time between consecutive observations on the same satellite is insufficient
- an unknown `satellite_id` or `target_id` is referenced
- the observation is not fully contained inside a continuous access interval for the target (this also enforces solar-elevation and off-nadir limits indirectly)
- the solar elevation at the target center at observation midpoint is below `min_solar_elevation_deg`

## Verifier outputs

The verifier returns a JSON report:

```json
{
  "valid": true,
  "metrics": {
    "valid": true,
    "coverage_ratio": 0.0,
    "normalized_quality": 0.0
  },
  "violations": [],
  "derived_observations": [...],
  "diagnostics": {
    "pair_evaluations": [...],
    "per_target_best_score": {...}
  }
}
```

**`valid`**: all hard constraints satisfied.

**`coverage_ratio`**: fraction of targets with at least one valid stereo or tri-stereo product.

**`normalized_quality`**: mean best-per-target stereo quality score across all targets.

**`derived_observations`**: per-action geometry computed by the verifier, including satellite ECEF state, boresight angles, solar angles, solar azimuth, slant range, effective pixel scale, and `access_interval_id`.

**`diagnostics`**: contains `pair_evaluations` (per-valid-product details including convergence angle, B/H proxy, overlap fraction, pixel scale ratio, bisector elevation, and asymmetry) and `per_target_best_score`.

## Stereo product definitions

### Valid stereo pair

Two observations `(i, j)` form a valid stereo pair when all of the following hold:

1. same `target_id`
2. one of the mission-allowed stereo modes:
   - same-satellite same-pass: same `satellite_id` and same `access_interval_id`
   - cross-satellite: different `satellite_id` values and `allow_cross_satellite_stereo: true`
3. midpoint separation `<= max_stereo_pair_separation_s`
4. AOI overlap fraction `>= min_overlap_fraction` (default 0.80)
5. convergence angle `min_convergence_deg <= gamma <= max_convergence_deg` (default 5–45 deg)
6. pixel scale ratio `max(s_i, s_j) / min(s_i, s_j) <= max_pixel_scale_ratio` (default 1.5)
7. all action-level hard constraints satisfied

The temporal constraint is a duration bound, not a UTC date-boundary rule. For example, observations centered at 23:59 and 00:01 can form a valid product if they satisfy `max_stereo_pair_separation_s` and the other pair rules.

### Valid tri-stereo set

Three observations form a valid tri-stereo set when:

1. all three share the same `target_id`
2. all three constituent pairs satisfy the mission-level same-satellite or cross-satellite mode rules and the bounded temporal constraint
3. common AOI overlap fraction `>= min_overlap_fraction`
4. at least two of the three constituent pairs are valid stereo pairs
5. one observation has `boresight_off_nadir_deg <= near_nadir_anchor_max_off_nadir_deg` (the near-nadir anchor)

## Quality model

### Pair quality

For a valid stereo pair:

```
Q_pair = 0.50 * Q_geom + 0.35 * Q_overlap + 0.15 * Q_res
```

where:

```
Q_overlap = min(1, overlap_fraction / 0.95)
Q_res     = max(0, 1 - (pixel_scale_ratio - 1) / 0.5)
```

`Q_geom` depends on the scene-type preferred convergence band:

| `scene_type` | preferred band |
|---|---|
| `urban_structured` | 8–18 deg |
| `vegetated` | 8–14 deg |
| `rugged` | 10–20 deg |
| `open` | 15–25 deg |

`Q_geom = 1.0` inside the band and at the band edges, and falls linearly to `0.0` outside. These are planning heuristics, not claims of universal photogrammetric truth.

### Tri-stereo quality

```
Q_tri = min(1, max(valid_pair_qualities) + beta(scene_type) * R)
```

`R` is a bounded redundancy-and-anchor bonus. `beta` values are read from `mission.yaml` under `tri_stereo_bonus_by_scene`.

### Per-target score

Each target's score is the maximum quality over all valid stereo and tri-stereo products covering that target.

## Primary ranking

Solutions are ranked first by validity, then by coverage, then by quality:

1. `valid = true`
2. maximize `coverage_ratio`
3. maximize `normalized_quality`

## Observation geometry model

The verifier propagates satellites with an SGP4-style propagator from the frozen TLEs.

**Access interval**: a maximal time window during which the target center is within `max_off_nadir_deg` and the solar elevation at the target is at least `min_solar_elevation_deg`. Two observations share the same `access_interval_id` when they fall within the same continuous access window.

**Effective pixel scale**:

```
effective_pixel_scale_m ≈ slant_range_m * pixel_ifov_deg * (pi / 180)
```

A local secant correction for off-nadir projection is applied.

**Footprint**: modeled as a pushbroom strip in a local tangent-plane approximation. The strip half-width at each sample is `slant_range_m * tan(radians(half_cross_track_fov_deg))`.

**Overlap**: estimated by Monte Carlo sampling within the circular AOI.

## What is intentionally out of scope

- cloud and weather modeling
- downlink, ground stations, contact windows
- onboard storage and power accounting
- unbounded temporal-baseline stereo products
- dense image matching internals
- bundle adjustment
- fine terrain occlusion or slope physics

## Running the tools

### Verifier

```bash
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.verifier.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/dataset/cases/test/case_0001 \
    path/to/solution.json

# Compact output (valid flag, metrics, violations only):
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.verifier.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/dataset/cases/test/case_0001 \
    path/to/solution.json \
    --compact
```

The verifier exits with code `0` when valid, `1` when invalid.

### Generator

```bash
# Re-generate the canonical dataset from the committed split contract.
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.generator.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/splits.yaml

# Write the dataset to another directory.
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.generator.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/splits.yaml \
    --output-dir /tmp/stereo_imaging_dataset

# Fetch and cache runtime sources only (operational mode; skips dataset emission):
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.generator.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/splits.yaml \
    --sources-only

# Force re-download of world-cities from Kaggle even when cached:
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.generator.run \
    benchmarks/stereo_imaging/splits.yaml \
    --force-download
```

The canonical generator writes cases under `dataset/cases/test/` and updates `dataset/index.json`. Runtime sources are staged under `dataset/source_data/`.

`splits.yaml` carries the benchmark-owned construction parameters plus an exact supported CelesTrak snapshot epoch label for the vendored real-TLE subset. The satellite TLE rows and sensor/agility profiles live in `generator/satellite_catalog.py`, so the split file stays focused on case counts, mission policy, and sampling parameters. The canonical mission horizon is anchored to that cached snapshot, and the generator rejects any other epoch because this benchmark does not ship alternate cached TLE snapshots.

`--sources-only`, `--download-dir`, and `--force-download` are retained operational modes around source staging; they are not alternate canonical dataset-construction contracts.

### Visualizer

```bash
# Case overview (ground tracks and target scatter map):
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.visualizer.run overview \
    --case-dir benchmarks/stereo_imaging/dataset/cases/test/case_0001

# Evaluated stereo product pages for a submitted solution:
uv run python -m benchmarks.stereo_imaging.visualizer.run products \
    --case-dir benchmarks/stereo_imaging/dataset/cases/test/case_0001 \
    --solution-path path/to/solution.json
```

The overview renders a small representative set of satellite ground tracks as a muted context layer so target geography remains readable on multi-satellite cases. Use `--max-ground-tracks` to increase, reduce, or hide that layer.

The products command writes human/VLM-facing PNG pages under `benchmarks/stereo_imaging/visualizer/plots/<case_id>/products/` by default. Use `--max-products` and `--products-per-page` to choose how many evaluated pair/tri-stereo products to render. Each product row includes a target-facing Earth view, a target-local ground swath overlap plot, look geometry, and concise product metrics.

### Tests

```bash
uv run pytest tests/benchmarks/test_stereo_imaging_verifier.py tests/benchmarks/test_stereo_imaging_generator.py
